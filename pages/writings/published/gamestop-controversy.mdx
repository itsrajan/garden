# Gamestop—An Imperfect Revolution

*Pubilshed By the International Junior Economist*<br/>

---
With the recent controversy involving GameStop Corp, the electronics retail company’s stock surged due to a shocking Reddit effort. The newly excited r/WallStreetBets group on Reddit single-handedly took down a large hedge fund and drove up GameStop stocks without looking back.

### Wait, What Happened?

The GameStop stock (GME) rose from approximately $18 per share to an astonishing $340 per share within a few days. Institutional investors, one of whom is the Melvin Capital hedge fund, recently saw an opportunity to use short selling to gamble on GameStop’s share price. With this information, Redditors decided to take matters into their own hands and teach the short-sellers a lesson. They created a group on Reddit called r/WallStreetBets, which was the birth of this economic revolution. Short sellers had borrowed and sold shares at their original price, with the intent that they could repurchase them later to save money. However, given recent news, they now had to repurchase these shares at their new incredibly high price leading to several losses. In fact, with Melvin Capital, they ended up losing 53%, which is equivalent to half of the company’s assets.

Short-selling, while perfectly legal, is unethical. A company will profit off of a reduction in the price of assets, which is a long-term risk. It’s kind of like if a friend lent you their car and you go and sell it, and when your friend wants it back, and you decide to rebuy the vehicle, hopefully at a lower price.

### Robhinhood

Robinhood is a share-dealing app where investors can purchase the stock of any publicly-traded company. They make it so easy for individuals to gamble their life’s income with a few taps. Rather than calling a broker or calling in, they can open an app, and have all the investment information available. Although it can be useful with extensive research, threats such as lack of caution and biased decisions are bound to happen.

However, what ended up happening is that after this extreme surge, Robinhood limited the purchasing of shares to 1 share per account for over 50 companies. Even though this resulted in outrage, the controversy alleviated. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez even scolded Robinhood for deciding to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.

### Amateur investors
Of course, given this historical moment in history, a wide variety of amateur investors are hoping to catch on. Take a 10-year-old Texan boy, for example. About a year prior, he received shares in GameStop as a birthday present. Since then, he has been waiting for an update and sees when he should sell. Little did he know that his gift would turn into over $3000 in cash for anything he wants to buy in recent days.

On a larger scale, this is a difficult moment for those interested in this dilemma. For example, Myron Sakkas, a student at Warwick University, described it as “not a free market.”

This is big news for amateur investors, but this is taking it too far. This is what happens when amateurs online enter an industry made to make rich people even richer. In essence, these are rookies fighting against the overpowering influence of Wall Street… and yet the underdogs find themselves triumphant.

### Mass Media

Social media is changing the world. For personal or corporate use, this is how individuals can go online and share their opinions and knowledge with the world. However, the resources provided to us in the 21st century have become a bit too powerful. For example, when well-known entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted, “Use Signal,” the uproar drove the application to number 1 on the App Store. Those two words represented what online communities can do in the 21st century. Later on, he tweeted “Gamestonk,” which played an influential factor in GME’s uprise.

Social media posts from influential CEOs and internet influencers spurred the business frenzy. Tweets and threads triggered Internet turmoil and eventually propelled the retail video game industry to a $24 billion market cap.

### Market Manipulation

When reading up on the issue, you might notice the phrase: market manipulation. This means overinflating or deflating a security price or otherwise exploiting the market’s actions for financial benefits. A statement from SEC states,
The Commission closely monitors and evaluates the extreme price volatility of individual stocks’ trading prices over the past several days to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.

Amid an unparalleled supply boom, Robinhood explicitly and purposely excluded the stock ‘GME’ from its trading platform, thereby depriving retail investors of the right to trade on the free market and control the competitive market. This suggests that the GameStop stock production was purposefully slowed down to manipulate the demand for the benefit of individuals and financial institutions who were not customers. While other clients contend that restrictions on court filings have resulted in fines, legal experts recognize that brokerages have a broad right to prohibit or restrict transactions where deals are made when individuals use their services.

### The Gamestop Effect

The future is rapidly developing. Current hedge funds observe Melvin Capital’s result during this life-changing problem and take this into deep considerations. The questions to ask now are what changes are going to be made to the system? What does this mean for future retail investors? Look what a few people online did to a company: we live in a community where we can say something online and change history. Social media is meant for online communication, but the fact that events as such occur clearly indicates that the global economy is demoralized. 

We are undemocratizing our economy. What’s next?
