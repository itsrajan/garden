## Amelia

> In the vast darkness of the night <br/>
> Who prevails is the strongest knight<br/>
> Who's sorrows become strength<br/>
> Who's possibilities find infinite length<br/>

> Strong, fast and brave on the inside<br/>
> Awaiting for his spirit to take on<br/>
> He tries so hard, but he remains lonely<br/>
> His journey continues to go on

> The armour of life pushes him down<br/>
> He doesn't know what to do<br/>
> He faced drawbacks throughout his life<br/>
> Until he met someone new
