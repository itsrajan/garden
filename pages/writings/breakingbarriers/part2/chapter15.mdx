## Mr. Garcia

To be completely honest, I like the first day of school. After I spend a few weeks working on the course content, this is my day to get everything together and rest. I am a political science and history teacher at the school, which means I have three classes per day… and might say this is a lot of marking. However, the students are really nice and hard working.

A couple of weeks before the first day, however, I was informed that a kid named Ryan, who had autism, would be in my class. This is what I don't understand. The quality of education has come down so low that a kid that can't even speak has to be in my class. Like who was in charge of this decision? After my first two classes, I head on over to the teacher's lounge. I don't have duty today, so that means I can actually take a chill pill. Not many people are in the teacher's lounge, but I want to start up some conversation.

"So did y'all hear about that autistic kid coming into the program?"<br/>
That immediately caught Ms. Patterson's attention… and her tone was not pleasing whatsoever.<br/>
"What do you mean?"<br/>
"If he can't keep up with the class, why should he be here?"<br/>
"Have you had a class with him yet?"<br/>
"Well, not yet, but I know what I need to know."<br/>

Ok. It's official. She is mad.<br/>
"Well, you shouldn't base your opinions on misinformation, or whatever goes on up there."

That's it. Too far. <br/>
"So tell me, how is he in your class?"<br/>
"He is a delight. A bit shy, but who isn't?"<br/>
"So he doesn't act like a normal student?"<br/>
"I never said that. He is brilliant and eager to learn. You will see in the last period."<br/>
"I highly doubt that"

Now, she brings in her irate voice.<br/>
"You know what, if you've got a problem, you can take it up with Ms. Stark. I'm done with dealing with people like you!"<br/>
"Are you talking about my race?"<br/>
"Obviously not. You very clearly know what I mean. Now, if you wouldn't mind, I would like to have a peaceful, discriminatory-less lunch."<br/>
Well, that was odd and violent. I guess not everyone has the same opinion. 

I'll just have to see for myself.
