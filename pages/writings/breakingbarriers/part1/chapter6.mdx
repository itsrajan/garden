# Paul Williams

What was that? I've been in many meetings in my life, and every time I have a pretty good idea of what I'm getting into. I don't want to sound like a mean father, but I don't want him to do this. I just don't know if he's ready. I hear Ryan close the door behind me and look directly at Ms. Stark. 

"What were you thinking?"
"Excuse me?"
"Ryan is a young, autistic boy. He won't be able to handle it."
"His teachers were very impressed with him this year. He is highly functional and will be fine."
"Maybe he will, maybe he won't. But it just doesn't make sense for you to bring this to him so suddenly."
"As you can see by his reaction, he is perfectly fine. In fact, he seems excited."
She is right. This is probably the first time I've ever seen him excited for something. Could this be good for him?
"That still doesn't matter. What if something happens, like he has a meltdown. Or if he can't make any friends?"

"We have spoken to a few students, and they are willing to spend some time with him to acclimate him to the mainstream."
"You have random students to become fake friends?"
"It's not like that"
What was she thinking? How could she do that to my son!?
"Then what is it like!?"

She takes a deep breath and then looks at the door.
"You saw your son's reaction. You know how much this will mean to him. He's ready."
Now that I think of it, he might be. He loved his chemistry classes, and he's been good at home. 
"You know what, we can try it out."
"That's amazing to hear."
"I'm going to talk to Ryan, see if we can sort this out."
A subtle smile appears on her face.
"I'm glad to hear. I'm quite sure the papers will love to write about him."
"Excuse me?"

"Well, I think people would want to read about him. A child with Asperger's going into the mainstream program will change the way society sees autism!"

She sounds optimistic, but I sense my voice getting angrier and angrier. 
"Let me get this right. You are using my son for the little publicity stunt you have going on?"
"Of course not!"
"You know what!? I was considering this. But now, I know the truth. That's it; I'm leaving."
"Mr. Williams- wait!"
I quickly grab my jacket and hat and storm out of the office.
"Ryan, we're leaving."
"But-"

"We're. Going."
