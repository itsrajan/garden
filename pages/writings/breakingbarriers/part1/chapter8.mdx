## Bobby Williams

I'm confused. All I know is that my brother stormed out, and my dad is angry. Quickly, I head out to the living room, only to see my dad staring at the floor painfully.

"Hey, dad… what's happening?"
"Ryan. He left. He hates me."
"Why would he hate you?"
"Something happened at school, it's a long story."
I've learned that it's best not to ask too many questions when people are in a bad mood. 
"I'm going after him."
"No point. It's been 5 minutes already."
"He doesn't know his way around town."
"You're talking about the kid that memorized the entire GPS so that we don't miss a turn."
"He does know his way around. But he's mad, so he just stormed out. He doesn't know where he's going"

My dad just looks at me, extremely confused.

"What?"
"He has no place to go, but actually, I think I know where he's headed."
Of course, this is just a hunch. He wouldn't have gone far, and he would have gone to someplace that he knew someplace that he would remember. 
I grab my shoes, jacket and Dumpling, head down the stairs to the front entrance and look both ways, trying to see if I can find him. After an immediate turn left, I approach the main road. In the distance, I see the back of a boy's head, in which I immediately recognized who it is. Without hesitation, I yell from the top of my lungs.

"Ryan!"

"Ryan!!"

He looks over… he stares for a long time and eventually gets up and walks away. Classic Ryan. I walk quickly, which turns into a jog, eventually leading into a full-fledged run. Sooner than expected, I arrive at the intersection and find Ryan quickly taking a left turn. I'm exhausted, but I know that seeing him is more important. I love him from the bottom of my heart. And I don't want anything ever to happen to him. 

Finally, I catch up to him, extremely out of breath. I'm about to hold on to his shoulder because I'm so tired, but I don't want to make things worse. What's interesting, though, is that Dumpling feels perfectly fine. He's just there, waiting for play.

"Ryan… I know you're angry. I'm not sure what caused this, but I need you to come back."
"No."
"Come on, Ryan! Why are you doing this?"
I make direct eye contact and see the sadness on his face. He doesn't want to talk, and he doesn't want to go back. I have an idea.
"Ryan… do you trust me?"
He nods.
"Do you trust me to take you somewhere? Not home."
He nods again.
"Alright. Just follow me."

The place where I want to go, it's a bit far, but it will be worth it. After about 15 minutes of walking, we pass by the Parliament. This is one of my favourite buildings because it looks so beautiful. The symmetry, the colours and most obviously, how big it is. Although it's always under construction, it doesn't really take away from its beauty. I look over to Ryan, and he seems tense. He looks as if he just wanted this to be over with.

"Bobby…"
"Yeah?"
"Did you take me to the Parliament just to tire me out?"
"No. Well, that would be a good idea now to think of it. But I have a better idea in mind. Another 2-3 minutes, and we will be there."
He looks even tenser now. I know he doesn't really like surprises. I learned that the hard way on one of his birthdays. 

"So, Ryan. When was the Parliament first built?"
I know he loves this topic, so I hope to let him talk, rather than having him bottle up his words, might help.

"This is interesting because Canada's independence and the Parliament being found were in 1867; however, the building was completed a year earlier. But then, in 1916, there was a fire which meant lots of construction. They then had to fix everything, which took them until 1927."

I have no clue how he just knows this stuff, but it looked like he just took a load off his back. We're almost there, so I'll just do one more.

"Why did they design the Parliament to look this way?"
"They focused on the theme of Gothic Revival. It's when you have both medieval and modern styles into one building. It's seen in several other buildings, such as St Mary of the Angels and Notre Dame in France."

I am a genius. I knew this would work. Just in time too! We head down on the right side until we reach a trail overlooking the canal. Dumpling is more excited than ever because he usually doesn't get these kinds of outings. This was a pleasant surprise. I head on over and sit down on the grass. Right next to me, I place down my jacket and tell Ryan to come to sit down. 

"Why did you take me here?"
"Don't worry about that. Just take in the view and the fresh air."
"Okay"

I lay back and enjoy the wind going surrounding my body. This is what I truly need in my life. 

"What happened at home?"
After a few long pauses, he brings it upon himself to answer.

"Dad was mean. He is bringing a new girlfriend over and is replacing mom."
"You're right, but he has been lonely. You've seen him. Always at work, just day in and day out."
"He is bringing a new girlfriend over. I don't like her."
"But you haven't even met her. You are just assuming the worst."
"At school today, Ms. Stark offered for me to go to the mainstream program full-time."
"That's amazing, Ryan!"
"Except Dad turned it down."
"Actually?"
"He said it's because he had all the leverage."
"Well, I know why he did that. He wants what's best for you. He wants to make sure that if you go there, that nothing bad will happen. Of course, he thinks this opportunity will be amazing, but it can only happen if things are best for you."

He just looks at me. I'm not sure what emotion he is feeling, but I'm pretty sure he is rethinking his approach to being mad right now. He then picks up Dumpling and strokes him gently. 

"Okay, time to go back now."
"I am so glad you're ready to head back"

I pick up our things, and we make our way home. I see Ryan just staring at me. It was a bit creepy, but his following words gave me an endless smile.
"Thank you."
"For what?"
"Being an amazing brother."
To my surprise, he leans in and hugs me. I don't remember the last time he did this.

This is truly a moment I will remember for the rest of my life.
