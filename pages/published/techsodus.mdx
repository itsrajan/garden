Silicon Valley has been home to the largest tech companies in the world: Apple, Alphabet, and Oracle, just to name a few. At the heart of innovation finding the right community, both environmental and interpersonal, is critical. However, as with many things, money is the driving force that can create a change in the way things are done; in the case of 2021 Silicon Valley, it is fuelling the push for a tech exodus.

Businesses need money to grow; large corporations need it even more. From market research to the development of a product itself, companies have continual significant expenses. The main objective is to be cost-efficient while keeping their market share, so when reducing these expenses is possible, dramatic measures may be taken.

With the product development, insurance, advertising, and legalities of owning a business, there are inevitable significant costs. While upgraded technology can reduce operating expenses, there remains a large cost that often isn‚Äôt taken into serious account: where the business is located.
On January 24, 2021, ‚ÄúOracle, the tech giant, announced it is moving its corporate headquarters from Redwood City, California, to Austin, Texas‚Äù (NBC News, 2021). Over the past few years, founders and large venture capitalists have made similar moves, migrating from Silicon Valley to places such as Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida.

### But, Why?

Living in Silicon Valley may feel like the ideal scenario; tech, resources, and the overall aura that the location provides, at the epicenter of growing tech. However, the truth is that it is expensive to live in such a modernized community.

Due to a crowded housing market, excessive taxation, and strict regulations, maintaining a business and even living in Silicon Valley is challenging. In direct comparison with Austin‚Ä¶
1. California‚Äôs top personal income tax rate ranges from 8% to 13.3%, while Texas has no income tax.
2. California has an income tax rate of 8.84%, while Texas has no corporation tax but does have a 1% franchise tax.
3. The sales tax in California is 7.25%, while the sales tax in Texas is 6.25%.

Now, amidst a global pandemic, finding new homes and business locations are even more difficult. A subsequent trend of CEOs, venture capitalists, and business headquarters are now in search of cheaper real estate, favorable tax laws, and more control over operations (Investopedia, 2020).
In a conversation with Matthew Frankel on the show Industry Focus, there was discussion about the basic reasoning behind this widespread trend.

The combination of Silicon Valley‚Äôs high taxes and high housing prices has resulted in significantly greater rent costs. [In Texas and Florida], state income taxes are not levied, and real estate is fairly priced. For a company seeking to purchase several hundred hectares of land for a new headquarters, Texas is more profitable than Silicon Valley. Miami is a popular destination for the same reason.

Frankel also mentioned how large companies such as Facebook and Apple have very large average salaries for their employees. ‚ÄúThe reason is not that they pay employees exorbitant amounts of money, it‚Äôs because it costs that much to live in Silicon Valley.‚Äù (Industry Focus, 2020)

### The Uphill Battle

Texas and Florida are expecting significant growth in the tech field, however, this is a very large change in a short period of time. Though there is excitement for companies making this shift, there is one thing that Silicon Valley has that Texas doesn't: a ban on noncompetes.
Noncompete provisions restrict workers‚Äô ability to move between companies of the same industry, or to begin their own ventures. Companies prefer to be able to discourage employees from moving to competitors. Even if proprietary technologies are formally protected by intellectual property laws and nondisclosure agreements, ideas will inevitably leak between companies as employees move. (BNN Bloomberg, 2021)
Despite these challenges, the movement of tech companies from Silicon Valley to around the country would encourage a more diverse community and new perspectives to the ever-growing industry. More federal regulations will probably need to be implemented to regulate how these companies function outside of California.

### The Bandwagon

Companies are planning to migrate across the United States; Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, and Elon Musk are just a few. Similar to lots of corporations, CEOs, and venture capitalists; Austin, Texas was found to be the ‚Äúbest position for growth‚Äù in order to provide personnel with more flexibility about where and how they work.

In turn, Hewlett-Packard (otherwise known as HP), is moving to Texas to build a brand new large campus in 2022, at lower costs with larger communities for employees. Lastly, Tesla is building a new headquarters and SpaceX will have new factories in Texas, under the supervision of CEO Elon Musk. The Musk Foundation had moved to Texas alongside his personal residence, which may have contributed to this decision (Observer, 2020).

###  Resolution

One by one, tech manufacturers, headquarters, and employees are moving across the United States. In an attempt to avoid the astronomical cost of living in Silicon Valley, reduce worker costs and get a refresh, companies are decentralizing their campuses and moving to considerably more favorable states. Silicon Valley may be the epicenter of tech in 2021, but it's not realistic for companies to spend more on land which could otherwise go towards the product itself.

This is not a simple shift but rather a movement; over the next decade, be prepared for a mass techsodus üöÄ
