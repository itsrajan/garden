# Hey, I'm Rajan ðŸ‘‹

> Honesty and transparency make you vulnerable. Be honest and transparent anyways. - Mother Teresa

I see that you've found your way to my little corner of the internet. I'm [Rajan Agarwal](https://heyrajan.com "Personal Website")â€”a 16 year old hacktivist based in Toronto ðŸŒ‡. I am a firm believer that the lack of transparency is synonymous to an inchoate digital presence. I'm on a mission to **think, build and ship** with emerging technology to create social change. 

Time is flying, which is why I spend my time with some of the most interesting and innovative people out there. You'll often catch me ranting on the
[Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com), chatting with youth changemakers or starting the occasional ~controversial~ discussion online. 

You'll often find me mindlessly scrolling on [Twitter](https://tw.heyrajan.com) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rajanwastaken/) during the day, and shipping new projects on [Github](https://g.heyrajan.com) at night. If you're in town, or want to chat, shoot me a DM or [schedule a call](https://calendly.com/rajanagarwal/30min).

Here, you will find a collection of thoughts, initiatives and writingsâ€”it is my pleasure to share this journey with you.

Welcome to my humble abode.
