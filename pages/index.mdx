> Honesty and transparency make you vulnerable. Be honest and transparent anyways. <br className="laptop"/> - Mother Teresa


I see that you've found your way to my little corner of the internet.  I'm <div className="clip">**Rajan Agarwal**</div>â€”a 16 year old hacktivist based in Toronto ðŸŒ‡. I am a firm believer that the lack of transparency is synonymous to an inchoate digital presence. In your exploration of my digital persona, I hope that you develop a profound understanding of my world, built on the foundation of creation and change. 

I'm on a mission to **think, build and ship** with emerging technology. It's true, innovation can be a weapon of mass destruction; as global citizens, it is our duty to utilize the power of the mind for better. 

Time is flying, which is why I spend my time with some of the most interesting and innovative people out there. You'll often catch me ranting on the
[Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com), chatting with youth changemakers or starting the occasional ~controversial~ discussion online. 


You'll often find me mindlessly scrolling on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajanwastaken) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rajanwastaken/) during the day, and shipping new projects on [Github](https://g.heyrajan.com) at night. If you're in town, or want to chat, shoot me a DM or [schedule a call](https://calendly.com/rajanagarwal/30min). Here, you will find a collection of thoughts, initiatives and writingsâ€”it is my pleasure to share this journey with you.  

Welcome to my humble abode, make yourself at home.
