> Honesty and transparency make you vulnerable. Be honest and transparent anyways. - Mother Teresa

Hey, I'm [Rajan Agarwal](https://heyrajan.com "Personal Website")â€”a 16 year old hacktivist based in Toronto ðŸŒ‡. I am a firm believer that the lack of transparency is synonymous to an inchoate digital presence; I'm on a mission to **think, build and ship**, through emerging technology and social change. Here, you will find a collection of thoughts, initiatives and writingsâ€”it is with great joy that I share my journey with you. 

Welcome to my humble abode.
