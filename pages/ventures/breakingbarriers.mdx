# Breaking Barriers

<Callout emoji="ðŸ“–">
 Breaking Barriers is a novel targeted to raise awareness about autism, from a more gentle stance. In this approach, it was my primary objective to introduce the topic in a familiar, friendly and relatively simple manner.

## ðŸŒ± About the Novel
Autism is rarely taught, and when it is, the content is subject to stereotypes and opinions. Ryan Williams, a 17 year old in Ottawa, aims to overcome these social norms during his experience in high school and working in a law practice. This book is meant for those between 8 and 13, tailored to youth that want to learn about autism, in a more friendly way. The novel features Ryan, an autistic teenager in Ottawa and his journey to become a lawyer in the 21st-century. As he breaks the barriers of societal norms, he builds friendships and new skills along the way.

> "Having autism is like a rock. It can be annoying and hard sometimes, but it's just a tiny obstacle when you look at the bigger picture" - Ryan Williams

## ðŸ›  Summary
His story begins in high school, where Ryan feels out of place in the special-ed class. A special meeting with the principal turns things around, providing him with an eye-opening opportunity in his senior year. Things go well, and Ryan is invited to study law in university. As time flies, his story continues at a law practice, where he is mentored and doubted by a variety of passionate and out-of-the-ordinary coworkers. His story is inspiring to many, but does it last? <br/><br/>
