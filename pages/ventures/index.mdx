## Ventures 

**Run For Hope**, My 160km Journey<br/> 
*July 2021* ‚Ä¢ Action & Awareness

This was a 160km run, in honour of 160 graves found at Kuper Island Residential School in British Colombia. The passion behind my Run For Hope was by the lack of fundamental awareness of the issue; I chose to spend 1 month running 160km and [tracking my journey](https://run.heyrajan.com).
<Callout emoji="üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è">
As a Canadian, seeing the discoveries of unmarked graves was heartbreaking. On July 12, 160 unmarked graves were discovered. Within the same time period, thousands more were found, symbolizing the treacherous conditions for indigenous families.

**Breaking Barriers**, Novel<br/> 
*March 2021* ‚Ä¢ Hope, Futures and Community

The novel tells the story of an autistic boy and his adventures to become a lawyer, which brought attention from the community, publishers and peers. I promptly distributed 25+ copies and raised awareness on my social media campaign; it is now my intention to donate physical copies of the novel to local libraries and the Autism Society.
<Callout emoji="üìñ">
Writing was never my forte. My peers and parents doubted me, but most importantly, I doubted myself. I had planned a computational future to avoid this obstacle, but came to realize that writing could supercharge my love for expression.

<Callout emoji="üéì">
As we continue to use technology on a daily basis, we need to ask the question: is it for the better? As students, we've experienced the effects of social media firsthand in our academic and social lives; we've realized that reality get's mixed up with propaganda and excessive marketing‚Äîwe want to share the truth.
