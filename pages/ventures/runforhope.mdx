# Run For Hope

## 💡 Inspiration
As a Canadian, seeing the discoveries of unmarked graves was heartbreaking. On July 12, 160 unmarked graves were discovered. Within the same time period, thousands more were found, symbolizing the treacherous conditions for indigenous families. 

While investigating further into the issue, I came across [David Babcock](https://www.mississauga.com/news-story/10436711-peel-teacher-to-walk-215-km-to-commemorate-unmarked-graves-at-former-residential-schools/), a teacher in my school board. Deeply affected by the news, he took it upon himself to hike 215km at local trails. His actions are what supercharged the passion behind my Run For Hope, in which I chose to spend 1 month running 160km and tracking my journey ~ a run for hope.

## 🏃‍♂️ About
My name is Rajan Agarwal. I am a 16 year old in Ontario interested in social change. My intentions with the Run For Hope were to build a community and raise direct awareness through a unique platform. 

While running may not be the most conventional and impactful strategy, this initiative reached **7000+ unique viewers** and promoted physcial wellness for peers that joined.

## 🌁 How It Went
I focused the majority of my impact and awareness on Instagram. Throughout the path, I contacted communities to share my initiative, made videos consistently marking my journey and ocassionaly posted on other social mediums.<br/><br/>
